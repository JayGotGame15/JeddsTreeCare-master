  <h1> Emerald ash borer (EAB)</h1>
  <p> Agrilus planipennis Fairmaire, is an exotic beetle that was discovered in southeastern Michigan near Detroit in the summer of 2002.
   The adult beetles nibble on ash foliage but cause little damage. The larvae (the immature stage) feed on the inner bark of ash trees,
   disrupting the tree's ability to transport water and nutrients.</p>

  <p> Emerald ash borer probably arrived in the United States on solid wood packing material carried in cargo ships or airplanes originating in its native Asia.
   As of October 2018, it is now found in 35 states,
  and the Canadian provinces of Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Manitoba.</p>
